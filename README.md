# Colony-Sim
Colony Sim game for Game Engines 4 and Game Production 6

I'd put trello link but I can't secure it, very sad

The goal of this game is a colony like sim where the player is an ant living among the ant hill of a world. It isn't set in an ant hill though, thats just a metaphor. The different npcs and characters in the game will make choices not based on set schedules and predifined routes but dynamically using the information they have gathered around them. It is a bit ambitious but I hope to get the core mechanics worked out sooner rather than later.
